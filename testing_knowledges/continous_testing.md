# What is continous testing ?

In this document, I would like to summarize the most important things about Continous testing, the detailed information about Why our trending is continous testing, even how we can apply some best-practice to your projects / products.

With the rising of Agile/ Scrum methodologies and Continous Delivery, the demands of ealier testing, receiving the testing result sooner are increasing highly, and our test trending is Continous testing, that helps our Developement team accelerate and priorotize testing to meet the expectation of faster development's speed, fast-paced in Agile/Scrum, Devops, ...

In the traditional testing approach, the speed of software delivery and ealier testing are limited.  Continuous testing and Agile testing will help us overcome the legacy problem on the old testing approaches.

+ Accelerate delivery with high confidence (Software).
+ Low business risk. (Feedback sooner, Business outcome is soon)
+ More realistic test, especially single application is built in microservice model (serveral services), isolated testing, more testing levels to cover more.
+ Continuous Integration - Continous delivery.

# Tranditional testing with several blockers:

Testing is a important in development and delivery of a software. The testing approach can affect not only to the way of assuring the quality of a Software Product, but also to the speed of delivery of our software.
In Software release's demands, we always hope to receive the feedback soon, reducing unacceptance risks, ... and specially to detect the risks, failures of 

In Tranditional testing approach, The tester or QA/QC will involve at the end of each release. Testing in Tranditional approach is a phase of a release. The most important thing in software testing, we can't do everything, all cases to assure our software has no error - "testing everything" approach. If we define and execute testing at the end of release. Your testing efforts will become the huge blockers, huge factors to your success's products.

In this image, we can see the more information about Tranditional testing and the issue that we can usually face in Tranditional Testing:
